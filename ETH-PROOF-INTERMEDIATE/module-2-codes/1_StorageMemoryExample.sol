// Storage Example
// In this example, the smart contractâ€™s state struct variable
// LotteryNumber is kept in storage, and data will persist
// between function calls.
contract StorageC {
    struct LotteryNumber {
        uint256 Lnumber;

    // Memory Example
    // In the above example, the num variable is stored
    // temporarily and locally in memory and it will be
    // released as soon as the function call is completed
    function multiply(uint256 num) external returns (uint256) {
